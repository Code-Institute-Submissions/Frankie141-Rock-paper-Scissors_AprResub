# Rock Paper and Scissors

Rock Paper and Scissors is a JavaScript based game where the player and the computer each make a choice. The Computer picks completely a random selection and depending on the choice of the player either the computer or player will win. The game will issue a message that states you win or you better luck next time. 

This game site contains two menu options, PlayGame and Instructions. This is simply a fun and quick game targeted at adults or children of all ages.
